                     An uplifting data-driven campaign foused on positivity and story telling to raise awareness on climate change and forest
                     regeneration in New Zealand.

               <p>
                  Capstone allowed me the opportunity and freedom to create a body of work in a field within media design that explored a topic or
                  problem I was passionate about. Coupling my expertise in UX/UI and love for the environment, this project explores how positive
                  data-humanism-driven interactive experiences create hope to motivate young New Zealanders to protect and preserve our nature.

         <section class="projectContent projectProblem">
            <div>
               <h5 class="capitalise">The Problem</h5>

               <p>
                  Our forests and green spaces are crucial in mitigating the impacts of climate change, providing homes to 80,000 native species in
                  New Zealand, producing oxygen and acting as carbon sinks. Furthermore, nature benefits our mental and physical well-being, providing
                  joy and connection.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The consequences of long-overlooked climate destruction are starting to show - protecting New Zealand’s unique environment has never
                  been more crucial than now. However, we often see information related to climate change concentrated on the doom and gloom
                  narrative. Though highlighting the impacts of climate change is necessary, all the information can be debilitating, especially
                  amongst Gen Z and Millennials who experience high levels of climate anxiety. A different approach is needed.

               <h5 class="capitalise">The Process</h5>
               <p>
                  Data humanism is a human-oriented approach to collecting and presenting information. Hence, understanding my user's motives and
                  needs was the first step. These insights helped inform my solution, providing ideas and opportunities. One core insight was that my
                  audience had limited time for sustainable actions, proving my solution had to be convenient. A digital experience became the core
                  part of my campaign, investigating how I could create more meaningful data visualisations on the relationship between people and
                  nature. This participatory data collection website was developed by mapping, sketching wireframes, building prototypes, testing and
                  refining before I began development. Consistent iteration through these steps was an integral part of the process.

               <p class="hideOnMobile">
                  However, during development, I realised the website was missing a hook. I devised many solutions to remedy this, but after
                  recognising these features were beyond my coding capabilities, I returned to the drawing board, brainstorming how else I could
                  communicate my message and expand my solution. Evergreen then became a campaign with new touch points that work alongside the
                  website, supporting one another to advocate for change to protect our nature.

                  <h5 class="capitalise">The Outcome</h5>
                  <p>
                     Evergreen explores how capturing personal stories and presenting them in a comprehendible, interactive and beautiful way could
                     create hope and bring change. The website - a participatory data collection experience - allows users to reflect on what nature
                     means to them and share this with others. It's a reflective and delightful experience that juxtaposes traditional forms of data
                     collection by focusing on storytelling.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     To expand Evergreen, social media content was designed and curated to directly reach the target audience and allow further
                     engagement with the brand. This included a series of infographics that tell positive climate stories like how afforestation
                     rates. Taking this positive approach provides hope, juxtaposing the idea that data related to climate change always has to be
                     negative.

                  Finally, not only do forests and green spaces aid in combating climate change, but they also play a role in our well-being. An
                  installation was created out of this insight to reconnect people with nature. Inspired by a comment left on the website, the
                  Evergreen Pod is an urban sanctuary where users can escape the city noise in a little native forest.

               <p>
                  The visual style for this project had to reflect the values of the outcome - positivity and sustainability. The brand identity is
                  bright and connects to the environment, pulling inspiration from Aotearoa's unique nature. The bright colours paired with the
                  playful illustrations of New Zealand native plants convey a friendly and fresh style that appeals to a younger target audience. This
                  positive style aligns with data humanism.

         <section class="projectContent projectConclusion hidden">
            <p>
               In essence, Evergreen explores how a more positive and solution-focused approach to climate change can enact change. Data
               visualisations are the heart of the campaign. These focus more on qualitative information - personal stories and experiences that
               connect people. This positive approach juxtaposes the idea that data is negative and complicated. It inspires and uplifts people
               instead of further inducing climate anxiety. Evergreen won't solve climate change, but it begins a transition towards a more
               sustainable future, motivating young people to take action, no matter how small, and to plant a seed for a better future, not just for
               the planet's benefit, but for our own.
