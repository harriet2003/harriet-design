               <h4>
                  For this project, I was required to create a design solution or creative project that explored a passion within the field of media
                  design. Through research and experimentation, I was able to deepen my knowledge within UX/UI, allowing me to learn and grow as a
                  designer.

               <h5 class="capitalise">The Problem</h5>

               <p>
                  Over the past decade, there has been a lot of change and uncertainty in the world, with COVID-19 being one of the most recent shifts
                  in our lives. This led to a rapid growth in technology and a sustained period of isolation for people, affecting mental health
                  hugely.
               </p>

               <p>
                  There is a lot of research that finding joy in life, no matter how small and through any intervention, can benefit your mental
                  health. Based on these insights, my research investigated how information design adopting the principles of data humanism can
                  positively address these bigger issues and how more meaningful and thoughtful representations of data can connect people.

            <div>
               <h5 class="capitalise">The Process</h5>
               <p>
                  There are many different approaches to gathering, analysing and presenting data that align with the data humanism ethos. This study
                  allowed me to explore these methods but in a way that is compassionate and personal, challenging notions of data being something
                  faceless and intimidating.

               <p>
                  I spent time unpacking the ideas behind data humanism to best apply these ideologies to my experiments. As it is a human-centred
                  concept, I prioritised testing my experiments to develop my solution, with each experiment informing the next. Every step taken
                  extended my knowledge, shaped the idea and built a solid foundation for my final solution supported by research and user feedback.

            <div>
               <h5 class="capitalise">The Outcome</h5>
               <p>
                  The final solution explored how data portraits could capture more personal and qualitative data. I developed a bright and welcoming
                  interface featuring a questionnaire to collect information on what people are grateful for.
               </p>
            </div>

            <p>
               The visual design of the interface was integral. Data humanism focuses on presenting data in a non-intimidating way. I considered how I
               could create an enjoyable and calming experience for the user.  
            </p>

            <img src="images/smallData/data-survey.png" alt="image of survey" />

            <p>
               A challenge faced was writing the questions for the survey. Gratitude is very personal to each person - it is difficult to measure the
               qualitative nature with numbers and algorithms. From these survey answers, using the p5.js library, a unique patterned symbol was
               generated that represented what the person was grateful for. The final data portraits bring people together and promote connectivity
               through shared experiences.     
            </p>

            <p>
               Data humanism embraces the complexity of life, moves beyond standards and can uncover meaningful insights about our world. The series
               of experiments, starting with participatory data installations and transitioning to a more digital experience, explored how data can be
               a powerful tool to enhance well-being.
