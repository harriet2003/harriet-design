               <p>
                  Over the past decade, there has been a lot of change and uncertainty in the world, with COVID-19 being one of the most recent shifts
                  in our lives. This led to a rapid growth in technology and a sustained period of isolation for people, affecting mental health
                  hugely. There is a lot of research that finding joy in life, no matter how small and through any intervention, can benefit your
                  mental health. Based on these insights, my research investigated how information design adopting the principles of data humanism can
                  positively address these bigger issues and how more meaningful and thoughtful representations of data can connect people.

               <p>
                  There are many different approaches to gathering, analysing and presenting data that align with the data humanism ethos. I began
                  with a more traditional method of collecting information - surveys then transitioned to mocking up an interactive installation
                  gathering data on what people were grateful for. However, I wanted to go down a digital route, so I explored how I could mirror this
                  experience with a website. This experimentation allowed me to build a final solution that was compassionate and personal,
                  challenging notions of data being something faceless and intimidating. I spent time unpacking the ideas behind data humanism to best
                  apply these ideologies to my experiments. As it is a human-centred concept, I prioritised testing my experiments to develop my
                  solution, with each experiment informing the next. Every step taken extended my knowledge, shaped the idea and built a solid
                  foundation for my final solution supported by research and user feedback.

                  <p class="bodyMedium bold">The Outcome</p>
                  <p>
                     Experimentation led me to a participatory approach to data collection through a digital platform. Users reported that involvement
                     in the data collection process made it more meaningful. The final solution explored how data portraits - a personalised designed
                     motif, could capture more personal and qualitative data. I developed a bright and welcoming interface featuring a questionnaire
                     to collect information on what people are grateful for. Based on their answers, a data portrait was generated.

               <p>
                  The visual design of the interface was integral. Data humanism focuses on presenting data in a non-intimidating way. I considered
                  how I could create an enjoyable experience for the user, following usability heuristics to create an easy-to-use experience with a
                  calming minimalist style. The colour palette is bright and warm to communicate a friendly tone of voice. I trialed many designs for
                  the portrait and settled for a circular shape that resembles a flower or sunburst. The different pattern rings look playful and come
                  together to form a unique symbol to that person.

            <p>
               Gratitude is very personal to each person - it is difficult to measure the qualitative nature with numbers and algorithms. This made
               creating the code difficult. Using the p5.js library and JavaScript,based on the users survey answers, I generated a unique patterned
               symbol that represented what that person might be grateful for. The final data portraits bring people together and promote connectivity
               through shared experiences.

               Data humanism embraces the complexity of life, moves beyond standards and can uncover meaningful insights about our world. The series
               of experiments I undertook, starting with participatory data installations and transitioning to a more digital experience, explored
               different data collection and presentation methods with a focus on people and the goal of enhancing well-being by celebrating the small
               things.
