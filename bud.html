               <p>
                  Everyone is feeling the crunch of the rising cost of living crisis with inflation hitting levels not seen since the 1980s. However,
                  my research discovered that it is those on a lower income, often the younger generation who are completing tertiary studies or are
                  early in their careers with lesser pay, who are struggling the most to maintain a work-life balance. Many young people lack basic
                  financial literacy to budget, save and plan for the future. A survey and discussions with my peers confirmed that this was a main
                  concern for my target audience. Financial education had to be the focus of my project.

               <p>
                  Finance has a reputation for being complicated and boring. My solution had to juxtapose this stigma to appeal to my younger
                  audience. It also had to be accessible and convenient for this audience which is why I created a digital tool. Iterating through the
                  design thinking process, I explored possible tools and features that would teach the basics of financial literacy engagingly. I
                  prioritised sketching, prototyping and testing my interface to build a solution backed by research and user feedback that appeals to
                  my audience’s needs.

                  <p>
                     Bud - is an easy-to-use digital platform to help people budget at a basic level. After testing my prototypes, I learned that the
                     solution had to be straightforward. Though I could cover a plethora of information and have many features, my audience wanted
                     simplicity. Therefore, the app kicks off the user's finance journey and teaches them the basics of financial literacy. Users can
                     create an account to track their expenses, set saving goals and learn simple tips and tricks. Money management can be
                     uncomplicated and empowering - this was the message I wanted to share.

               <p class="bodyMedium bold">The Visual Design</p>

               <p>
                  The coded app was accompanied by a brand package consisting of social media posts, posters, billboards and plans for a pop-up
                  participatory installation. Creating a brand identity that was bold and playful presented finance as something inclusive,
                  juxtaposing the mundane stigma. The vibrant colour palette reflects this positive tone of voice. Green is often associated with
                  money and growth, contrasting it with a pop of orange creates warmth and the softer purple tones down the bright colours. The
                  hand-drawn illustrations further the friendly vibe and represent the journey to financial freedom. The logo - Bud - also doubles as
                  a cheerful character, your financial buddy.

               Solving the challenges associated with the rising cost of living was never possible with this project. The goal is that this app will
               start inspiring young people to build positive money habits and to have the confidence to be their own money masters.
