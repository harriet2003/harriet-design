                  It’s well known that New Zealand has a strong binge drinking culture - two out of five New Zealanders between 18 and 24 years of age
                  drink at levels which pose a risk to themselves and others. Even though there is a lot of information and existing initiatives
                  tackling this issue, the messages aren’t getting through to the audience. A different approach is needed. The team - a graphic
                  designer, lead researcher, interactive designer and myself as UX/UI designer and team leader, were challenged to create a campaign
                  that acknowledges this harmful relationship Kiwi youth have with alcohol, exploring creative opportunities that would increase
                  awareness of the issue and initiate a behavioural change within the target audience.

               <p>
                  Beat the Binge is a bold and uplifting campaign dedicated to supporting our audience in curbing binge drinking tendencies through
                  music-themed, pop-up interactive events located around common drinking areas. Through research of our target audience’s motivations
                  and unpacking solutions of similar subjects, we discovered a priority of our campaign should be the tone of voice.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The younger generation tends to respond poorly to accusatory and direct messaging. This is because our audience values authenticity
                  and transparency, and aggressive tactics can be seen as intrusive. By gently steering behaviour and offering appealing, alcohol-free
                  alternatives on a night out, we aim for a natural progression - encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption among our target
                  demographic.

               <p>
                  We crafted an energetic visual identity, brought to life with bold colours, playful illustrations and a friendly, wobbly character.
                  Through the cheeky, relatable copyright and visual identity, an uplifting and lively voice is communicated.

                  <p>
                     Bud - is an easy-to-use digital platform to help people budget at a basic level. After testing my prototypes, I learned that the
                     solution had to be straightforward. Though I could cover a plethora of information and have many features, my audience wanted
                     simplicity. Therefore, the app kicks off the user's finance journey and teaches them the basics of financial literacy. Users can
                     create an account to track their expenses, set saving goals and learn simple tips and tricks. Money management can be
                     uncomplicated and empowering - this was the message I wanted to share.

               Our commitment lies in gently transforming the harmful alcohol consumption habits engrained in New Zealand society, especially among
               youth. By a form of messaging that is light and honest, we can actively engage our younger audience and start this behavioural change,
               shifting our attitudes and perceptions towards alcohol consumption.
