                  world we live in.

               <p>
                  Everyone is feeling the crunch of the rising cost of living crisis with inflation hitting levels not seen since the 1980s. However,
                  my research discovered that it is those on a lower income, often the younger generation who are completing tertiary studies or are
                  early in their careers with lesser pay, who are struggling the most to maintain a work-life balance.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Many young people lack basic financial literacy to budget, save and plan for the future. A survey and discussions with my peers
                  confirmed that this was a main concern for my target audience. Financial education had to be the focus of my project.

               <p>
                  Finance has a reputation for being complicated and boring. My solution had to juxtapose this stigma to appeal to my younger
                  audience. Iterating through the design thinking process, I developed possible tools and features that would teach the basics of
                  financial literacy engagingly. I prioritised sketching, prototyping and testing my interface to build a solution backed by research
                  and user feedback that appeals to my audience’s needs.

                  <p>
                     Bud - is an easy-to-use digital platform to help people budget at a basic level. The app, supported by databases, allows users to
                     track their expenses, set saving goals and learn the basics of financial literacy.  Money management can be uncomplicated and
                     empowering - this was the message I wanted to share.

               <p>
                  The coded app was accompanied by a brand package consisting of social media posts, posters, billboards and plans for a pop-up
                  participatory installation. Creating a brand identity that was bold and playful presented finance as something inclusive,
                  juxtaposing the mundane stigma.
               </p>

               <p>
                  The vibrant colour palette reflects this positive tone of voice. Green is often associated with money and growth, contrasting it
                  with a pop of orange creates warmth and the softer purple tones down the bright colours. The hand-drawn illustrations further the
                  friendly vibe and represent the journey to financial freedom. The logo - Bud - also doubles as a cheerful character, your financial
                  buddy.

               Solving the challenges associated with the rising cost of living was never possible with this project. The goal is that this app will
               start inspiring young people to build positive money habits and to have the confidence to be their own money masters.
