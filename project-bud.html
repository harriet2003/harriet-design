               <p>
                  Everyone is feeling the crunch of the rising cost of living crisis with inflation hitting levels not seen since the 1980s. However,
                  it is those with a lower income, often the younger generation who are completing tertiary studies or are early in their careers with
                  lesser pay, who are struggling the most to maintain a work-life balance.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Many young people lack basic financial literacy to budget, save and plan for the future. This was the main concern for my target
                  audience. From this insight, I knew education had to be the focus of my project.

               <p>
                  Finance has a reputation for being complicated and boring. My solution had to juxtapose this stigma. Through research, both primary
                  and secondary, I developed possible tools and features that would teach the basics of financial literacy engagingly. Iterating
                  through the design thinking process with a priority on prototyping and testing allowed me to build a solution backed by research and
                  user feedback that appeals to my audience’s needs.

                  <p>
                     Bud - is an easy-to-use digital platform to help people budget at a basic level. The app, supported by databases, allows users to
                     track their expenses, set saving goals and learn the basics of financial literacy.  Money management can be uncomplicated and
                     empowering - this was the message I wanted to share.

                  The coded app was accompanied by a brand package consisting of social media posts, posters, billboards and plans for a pop-up
                  participatory installation. Creating a brand identity that was bold and playful presented finance as something inclusive,
                  juxtaposing the mundane stigma.

                  The vibrant colour palette and hand-drawn illustrations reflect this positive tone of voice. The friendly logo also doubles as a
                  character - your financial buddy.

               Solving the challenges associated with the rising cost of living was never possible with this project. The goal is that this app will
               start inspiring young people to build positive money habits and to have the confidence to be their own money masters.
